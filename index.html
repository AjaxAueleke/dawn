    <p>
      The United States announced on Friday it was revoking the designation of
      Yemen’s Houthi rebels as a terrorist group effective February 16, a
      reversal by the Biden administration which was welcomed by the United
      Nations and humanitarian groups who feared former president Donald Trump’s
      actions would impede aid deliveries to the conflict-torn country facing
      the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called President Joe Biden’s decision
      to rescind the designation “a recognition of the dire humanitarian
      situation in Yemen”.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said the new US administration listened to warnings from the United
      Nations, humanitarian groups, bipartisan members of Congress and others
      “that the designations could have a devastating impact on Yemenis’ access
      to basic commodities like food and fuel”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yemen imports 90 per cent of its food, nearly all purchased through
      commercial channels, and UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock warned last
      month that the US designation of the Houthis already had companies pulling
      back from dealing with the Yemenis and would likely lead to “a large-scale
      famine on a scale that we have not seen for nearly 40 years”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blinken’s announcement followed a phone conversation on Thursday with UN
      Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, where Yemen was one of the issues they
      discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric on Friday called the US action “extremely
      positive”.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We hope that helps build momentum for a political solution to the
      conflict in Yemen,” Dujarric said. “I think the reversal of the
      designation, the naming of the [US] special envoy [for Yemen], and the
      clear, clear language from the top of the administration, from president
      Biden himself, expressing his strong support for the UN-led mediation
      process [...] are very, very welcome indeed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2014, the rebel Houthis overran the capital, Sanaa, and much of Yemen’s
      north, driving the government into exile. A US-backed, Saudi-led coalition
      intervened the following year to try and restore the internationally
      recognised government, but years of UN efforts to get both sides to agree
      to a ceasefire and start peace negotiations have not succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blinken said the United States “remains clear-eyed” about the Houthis’
      “malign actions and aggressions including taking control of large areas of
      Yemen by force, attacking US partners in the Gulf, kidnapping and
      torturing citizens of the United States and many of our allies, diverting
      humanitarian aid, brutally repressing Yemenis in areas they control, and
      the deadly attack on December 30, 2020 in Aden against the cabinet of the
      legitimate government of Yemen.”
